                After carfully looking at Grapple's abilities it would be a shame to not use either of them. So my first
                step was figuring out which
                battle icons I must have in my deck. The first that came into mind is the White battle icon, as we see
                in his bot mode we will need to flip exactly 4 different
                icons and flipping a White during battle allows us to flip two more cards increasing our chances of
                getting his ability going. At this point knowing that
                White icons will have a huge influence in this deck with there count likely making up at 25% of the
                deck, I knew who to team him up with. Say hello to...

                Alright now that I have assembled my team it's time to figure out the rest of the battle icons.
                We have White as our first icon, and after looking at our average attack being 3.5 in alt mode and 3 in
                bot mode (not counting abilities) it's not very high.
                Which conclude black be the second icon, and since we will be flipping a lot of battle icons due to
                Seawatch's ability and the Rescue Patrols making up 75% of the team.
                We might as well use the green battle icon to pick up cards and gurantee more consistant games. As for
                our last Icon, I decide to go with orange to up our bot's attacks and
                to maximise the use of Grapple I will prioitize double pip cards and in one case triple icon cards over
                single pip cards. (I'll explain as this article continues.)
            </div>

            <div id="para">
                The first battlecard that is the main focus in this deck is
                <div class="tooltip"> Pocket Processor
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/ws2/battle/pocket-processor-WS2.jpg"
                            alt="Pock Processor TCG Card" style="width:100%">
                    </span>
                </div>. A battlecard utility upgrade with a single green pip, that allows the user to draw a card at the
                start of their turn.
                Having this equipped before using Grapple's bot mode ability will ensure our hand replenishes and in
                turn allows us to use Grapple's alt mode ability multiple times in a game.
                I personal always place this utility on Seawatch but, depending how your match goes it's entirely up to
                the user. The next obvious choice is to add
                <div class="tooltip"> Wedge Formation
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/ws2/battle/wedge-formation-WS2.jpg"
                            alt="Wedge Formation TCG Card" style="width:100%">
                    </span>
                </div>
                , which helps in many ways. First off it is a triple icon battlecard [Orange, Black, Green] allowing us
                to pick it up after a battle or meeting 3 of the 4 icons needed
                when flipping Grapple from bot mode to alt mode. If need we can also play this card and gain two of it's
                effects, healing 1 from a melee character (aka Grapple) and planning
                1 if we have a specialist (Rescue Patrols). In most scenarios planning 1 isn't as important unless
                you're attacking with Grapple in bot mode towards an enemy in which case
                planing a white icon card would be advised.
            </div>

            <div id="para">
                Now the next few battlecards are to help with our attacking first up are weapons.
                <div class="tooltip"> Combat Dagger
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/wcs/battle/combat-dagger-WCS.jpg"

                    </span>
                </div>
                a Orange Black icon card that provides <b>bold 1</b> to a character and
                <div class="tooltip"> Kinetic Intensifier Whip
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/ws2/battle/kinetic-intensifier-whip-WS2.jpg"
                            alt="Kinetic Intensifier Whip TCG Card" style="width:100%">
                    </span>
                </div>
                a White icon battlecard that when the upgraded character is flipped from one mode to another the
                character gains <b>bold 2</b>. I want to start off by saying
                I realy enjoy Kinetic Intensifier Whip, that even if an opponents card causes you to scrap this before
                battlecards are flip, your character still
                keeps the bold it recieved from this card. Using this card on either Grapple or the Rescue Patrol grants
                value, either by increasing your chances at popping Grapple's
                bot mode ability or increasing the chances of flipping more White icons when on a Rescue Patrol
                (flipping at least 2 White icons during battle allows the character to flip an additional 3
                battlecards).
                Some actions cards I would like to touch up on are
                <div class="tooltip"> Fight For Position
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/ws2/battle/fight-for-position-WS2.jpg"

                    </span>
                </div>
                a Orange Black icon card that provides <b>bold 2</b> to a character until end of turn and
                <div class="tooltip"> Escape Route
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/roc/battle/escape-route-ROC.jpg"

                    </span>
                </div>
                a White Green icon card that allows us to flip any of our bots from bot mode to alt mode. There's a nice
                little combo with this card and previously mentioned Kinetic Intensifier Whip,
                where it becomes possible to give one of your characters <b>bold 4</b>. Escape Route has the green icon
                that allows us to pick it up making it more consitant to pick up and play
                or pick it up and collect those two icons to be discarded later when using Grapple's alt mode ability.

                As you may notice there are a few cards that we cant actually play during a game but, they do serve a
                purpose. The cards I'm refering to are
                <div class="tooltip">Opportune Repairs
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/ws2/battle/opportune-repairs-WS2.jpg"
                            alt="Opportune Repairs TCG Card" style="width:100%">
                    </span>
                </div> (which requires a Mercenary to be on the starting team),
                <div class="tooltip"> Terrifying Resilience
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/ws2/battle/terrifying-resilience-WS2.jpg"
                            alt="Terrifying Resilience TCG Card" style="width:100%">
                    </span>
                </div> (Can not go on Autobots), and
                <div class="tooltip"> Composite Armor
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/ws2/battle/composite-armor-WS2.jpg"

                </div>
                (Can only be placed on Tanks). This is fine because three reasons, first you can always swap them out of
                your hand after battle for a Green icon card. Two if you have a Green icon and White icon
                also in your hand you can discard them when Grapple flips to alt mode and deal 4 damage directly to an
                enemy. Lastly they are all Orange and Black icon cards which gurantees
                1 point of damage when flipping them during an attack. There are also some support cards for Grapple
                such as
                <div class="tooltip">Sparring Gear
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/roc/battle/sparring-gear-ROC.jpg"
                            alt="Sparring Gear TCG Card" style="width:100%">
                    </span>
                </div> (Which I always place on Grapple to help out his bot mode gain +4 defense or again use the battle
                icons for Grapple's Alt mode ability) and
                <div class="tooltip">Swerve
                    <span class="tooltiptext">
                        <img src="https://images.fortressmaximus.io/cards/ws2/battle/swerve-WS2.jpg"
                            alt="Swerve TCG Card" style="width:100%">
                    </span>
                </div> (White and Black icon, increasing our flips in battle and in some rare cases be used to activate
                Grapples Alt mode ability on the opponents turn). There's a few more cards I won't go over and I assume
                they are self explanatory
                at this point.

                Over all I'm happy with this build and I've had success with the outcome so far, I think I've spent the
                most time on this challenge compared to the previous ones.
                I just had so many different ideas, (Overwhelming Advantage? Battle Patrol? Sport Car Patrol?) before
                settling down and focusing on using Grapple's main abilities and
                which support characters would go well with him. I think I've rambled enough, thank you for your time
                and I hope to see you all again soon!
